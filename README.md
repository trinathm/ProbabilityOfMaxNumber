# ProbabilityOfMaxNumber
Program to find probability of getting max number for the given no of sides with total number of dice

User need to enter total number of dice he is going to use for game. 

If user gives 2 as total dice, then max number will be 2 * NUM_SIDES = 12 (as we have given NUM_SIDES as 6)

So it will return max number of attempts it will get max number. 

Max attempts will keep on changing from one run to another run :)
